# Refactoring-homework
First I made a new repository in Github named "Refactoring-homework"
Afterwards I git clone it to my computer using git bash
Once that was completed I went onto our Bootcamp site and cloned the starter code onto my computer
Once all that was completed I opened VS code and paste the stater code.
Now i'm ready to start my assignment!
I first added a Title of the website to "Horiseon Market Agency".
Next I changed the semantic elements to Header, Main, Aside, Footer.
Afterthat I went into the the Header and labeled the NAV with its ul.
Went into the main and changed the div to the section's of the site.
Then i added the Hero img into the header with a div to be part of the header.
Went into the CSS and combined all similiar CSS to have fewer lines to read.
Reviewed the page and all heading attributes to see if they lineup.
Next I gitt add -A, Git commit -m "Homework update2" and they git push all my changes.
Once thats completed I went to setting, pages and set up a deployed link.
Next I went to Bootcamp site and submitted my two links. One is my deployed URL, and the other is my repository URL
